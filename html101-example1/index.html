	<h1>One hen, Two ducks, </h1>
	<h2>Three squawking geese, Four limerick oysters,</h2>
	<h3>Five copulent porpoises, Six pairs of Don Alverzo's tweezers,</h3>
	<h4>Seven thousand Macedonians in full battle array, Eight brass monkeys from the ancient sacred crypts of Egypt,</h4>
	<h5>Nine apathetic, sympathetic, diabetic old men on roller skates, with a marked propensity towards procrastination and sloth,</h5>
	<h6>Ten lyrical, spherical, diabolical denizens of the deep who all stall around the corner of the quo of the quay of the quivery, all at the same time.</h6>
